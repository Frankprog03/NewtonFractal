I rediscovered this "ancient" project of mine I did for some school project. I made this in a few hours, and it's terribly optimized (it runs on javascript lol). Maybe one day i'll port this to a GLSL shader, and compute it on real-time. For now, it's not that bad as it does its job nicely, but it scales terribly as the number of coefficients grow.

Feel free to reuse this code for any purpose. It's nothing special.
